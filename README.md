# WeRateDogs_project
This project corresponds to the 4th project of Udacity "**Data Analysis Fundamental**". 
Here I will be working with data from [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account. The objective is to do all the process of data wrangling (gathering, assessing, cleaning and storage) and then a short analysis of data.

Here I will work with 3 different archives:
- WeRateDogs Twitter File, from Udacity team, where have information about rated dogs from tweets.
- Image Predictions File, where a neural network classifies breeds of dogs base on the photograph in the tweet.
- Additional Data via Twitter API. Unfortunately, I can't get the development account from Twitter and for time matters I will work with the file provided by Udacity.
